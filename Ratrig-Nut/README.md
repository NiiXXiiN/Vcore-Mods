## RatRig Nut ##

This is a cosmetical replacement for the magnetic door closing part that is attached to the door. Instead of screwing a M6 screw from outside to inside and fixing it with a nut on the inside, I flip the screw and attach this printed nut from the outside. For this to work you need to have a M6x7 screw or cut one to length. You can print the part with color change if you like! For the bottom variant I created a simple plastic nut...
