## X-Endstop reverse mount ##

This is my mechanical endstop mount for the X Endstop that mounts to the frame instead to the print head. This requires that when homing you first home Y and only then home X, but this can be configured in all firmwares that I know of. I also modded the Y endstop mount so that it gives more room to the x-endstop mount.
