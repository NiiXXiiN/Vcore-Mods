## Lid ##

This mod adds a top lid to the 300 VCore3. It is a mod of cyborgcnc's design: ![]https://github.com/cyborgcnc/CYBORGCNC__RRVC3MOD - I had some problems with Phil Brickwood's mod of the original design and decided to adjust it to my needs: I increased the height by 20 mm, modified the corner brackets so that you have identical length cross bars all around (there are 4 bottom and 4 top bars to print), removed the LED strip recess, added a mounting hole for a web cam in the front left corner and added bottom joiner clips with a cable clip for the webcam cable and an outlet tunnel in the back left corner for the webcam cable (my webcam does not connect to a Pi on the electronics panel) and I added hinge holes to an optional lower back cross bar which werent included in Phil's files (even though personally I don't use the hinges as I don't have enough space behind my printer to use it).

You will need to print the two top corner brackets twice, 4 side clips, 8 bottom and 8 top clips.

DXF files for the panels are provided. It is designed for 3mm panels together with 1mm of compression (5mm wide) tape or similar.

You also need M3 heat inserts, sized "M3-.05 SHORT" - if you already have heat inserts, maybe check the hole sizes and adjust accordingly.
