## Internal Spool roller and filament monitor ##

This adds 2 rollers to put a 1kg filament spool on. Additionally the filament is fed into a guide that connects a PTFE 4/2 tube to a BTT smart filament monitor or a simple mechanical switch to trigger run out. Optional spool presence switch (that trips if the spool jumps off the rollers).
