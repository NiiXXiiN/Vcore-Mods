## Internal Spool roller and filament monitor ##

This adds 2 rollers to put a 1kg filament spool on. Additionally the filament is fed into a guide that connects a PTFE 4/2 tube to a BTT smart filament monitor or a simple mechanical switch to trigger run out. Optional spool presence switch (that trips if the spool jumps off the rollers). The rollers can be mounted with groove facing inside or outside to the frame, making a difference in maximum possible filament roll width. When the groove is near the outside, the filament roll cant be as wide, but the filament roll is then further away from the moving bed and most of the time this is the recommended setup. Only if spool is wider than about 72 mm, you need to flip rollers around. Please check bed clearance by moving it down before printing!

The filament guide that follows the rollers has a 1/4" thread on it's outside to screw in a pneumatic coupler to securely connect a 4mm PTFE tube. Personally I use a BTT smart filament monitor for which I also include a replacement back plate mount to put it next to the vertical 3030 extrusion in the middle of the electronics back plate. I moved the top corner bracket that holds this 3030 to the other side of it to have more space to mount the BTT sensor.

If you want, you can use my microswitch incorporated filament guide instead of the BTT sensor.

Last not least I created a little mount for another endstop style micro switch that will allow to monitor if the filament spool is sitting in the rollers. The mount also acts as a little guide to the spool itself and needs to be adjusted. You can adjust the height of the filament spool by adjusting the spacing between the rollers and you can also adjust the switch height. This guide/switch is attached to a scrap piece of 3030 extrusion. Actually I didnt have one at hand and simply printed 100mm of that from ASA as this is only needed to hold the guide in place and allow for width adjust.

You need 2 x 608 bearings and a 8mm rod, 94mm long for each roller.
